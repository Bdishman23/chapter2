Description: When first starting to study a group, a student may do some basic
    analyses: make a phylogeny, look to see who else is working on the group,
    gather traits, do comparative analyses. This automates all that. This has
    two advantages: for groups with no one studying them, it provides some info.
    For groups that are being actively studied, this gives a launch into their
    study.
