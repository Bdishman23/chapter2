# chapter2
Project to quickly provide an overview of a clade, as a starting point for human-driven analysis.

This is inspired by projects such as Rod Page's iSpecies or the Sanderson et al.'s phylota, as well as by the issues we frequently see in students first learning about phylogenetics.

This is for our lab's latest hackathon on May 29, 2019.

Basic structure:

## Getting data

Data sources:

* gbif
* genbank
* paleobiodb
* EOL trait bank
* Open Tree of Life
* Datelife

## Processing data

* cleaning data
* converting into more usable forms (latitude and longitude -> biogeographic regions)

## Doing analyses

* diversification models: tree only
* diversification models: tree plus trait
* correlation: continuous traits
* univariate models for continuous and discrete (phylo signal, OU/BM, etc.)
* biogeographic models


## Creating report

Make a sensible, readable summary. Can we create a bot that creates basic papers on a clade? A web page with tables, figures, and downloadable data?
